# Simple Interest Calculator

## Overview
This is a simple calculator that computes the simple interest based on the given principal amount, annual rate of interest, and time period in years.

## Formula
The formula to calculate simple interest is:

```
Simple Interest = Principal Amount (P) × Time (T) × Rate of Interest (R)
```

## Input Parameters
- **P**: Principal amount (Initial investment or loan amount)
- **T**: Time period in years
- **R**: Annual rate of interest (in decimal or percentage form)

## Output
- **Simple Interest**: The calculated interest amount

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-interest-calculator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd simple-interest-calculator
   ```
3. Run the script (Python example):
   ```sh
   python interest_calculator.py
   ```

## Example Calculation
If:
- **P = 1000** (Principal amount)
- **T = 3** (Time in years)
- **R = 5%** (Annual interest rate)

Then:
```
Simple Interest = 1000 × 3 × (5/100)
               = 150
```
